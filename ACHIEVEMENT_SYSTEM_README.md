# Achievement Management System

## Overview

The Achievement Management System is a comprehensive solution that allows faculty members to submit their achievements (research, publications, patents, etc.) for HOD approval. The system ensures that achievement counts only increase after proper verification and approval by the Head of Department.

## Features

### üéØ For Faculty Members
- **Submit Achievements**: Upload PDFs and provide details for various achievement categories
- **Track Submissions**: Monitor the status of submitted achievements (pending, approved, rejected)
- **View Statistics**: See submission counts and approval rates
- **Download PDFs**: Access submitted documents for reference

### üîç For HODs (Heads of Department)
- **Review Panel**: Comprehensive interface to review all faculty submissions
- **Approve/Reject**: Make decisions on achievement submissions with notes
- **Filter & Search**: Find submissions by status, category, or department
- **Update Counts**: Automatically update faculty achievement counts upon approval

## Achievement Categories

| Category | Database Field | Description |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| Research & Development | `rdProposals` | Research proposals, papers, grants, projects |
| Publication | `journalPublications` | Journal articles, conference papers, books |
| Innovation & Patents | `patents` | Patent filings, innovations, technology transfer |
| Student Engagement | `studentProjects` | Student mentoring, projects, workshops |
| Professional Development | `fdpWorks` | FDP workshops, certifications, training |
| Industry & Others | `industryCollabs` | Industry collaborations, consultancy, visits |

## How It Works

### 1. Submission Process
1. Faculty member logs into the system
2. Navigates to **Achievements** ‚Üí **Submit Achievement**
3. Selects achievement category and type
4. Uploads supporting PDF document
5. Provides title, description, and achievement value
6. Submits for HOD review

### 2. Review Process
1. HOD accesses **Achievements** ‚Üí **Review Panel**
2. Views all pending submissions with filters
3. Downloads and reviews PDF documents
4. Approves or rejects with review notes
5. System automatically updates faculty achievement counts

### 3. Count Update
- **Approved**: Achievement value is added to the corresponding faculty field
- **Rejected**: No count update, faculty can see rejection reason
- **Pending**: No count update until HOD decision

## Database Schema

### New Table: `achievement_submissions`
```sql
CREATE TABLE achievement_submissions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  faculty_id TEXT REFERENCES faculty(id),
  category TEXT NOT NULL,
  submission_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  pdf_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  submission_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
  reviewed_by TEXT REFERENCES faculty(id),
  reviewed_at TIMESTAMP,
  review_notes TEXT,
  achievement_value INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  academic_year TEXT,
  semester TEXT
);
```

### Storage Bucket: `achievement-pdfs`
- Private bucket for secure PDF storage
- 10MB file size limit
- PDF files only
- Access controlled by user authentication

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Migration
Run the new migration to create the achievement submissions table:
```bash
# Apply the new migration
psql -h your-supabase-host -U postgres -d postgres -f supabase/migrations/03_create_achievement_submissions_table.sql
```

### 2. Storage Setup
Set up the Supabase storage bucket for PDFs:
```bash
# Install dependencies if needed
npm install @supabase/supabase-js

# Run storage setup script
node scripts/setupStorage.js
```

**Manual Setup Alternative:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage
2. Create bucket named `achievement-pdfs`
3. Set as private (not public)
4. Add policies for authenticated users

### 3. Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in your `.env` file:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-supabase-service-key
```
